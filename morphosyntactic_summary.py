#goal: provide a user friendly description of morphosyntactic analysis

#read in morphosyntax-user friendly pairs to dict (tuple if you want reversible)
#extract morphosyntax portion of analyzed word -> delimit where lexical material is
#check morphosyntax against reference unit, obtain user friendly translation
#check lexical material against gloss mapping (if available, else, it will just be the lemma)
