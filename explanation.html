    <h1>Grammatical Code Explanation</h1>
    <div id="codes_explainer"></div>
    <p>See below for lists of grammatical codes produced by the analyzer. All lists are alphabetized. There is a section of codes from the Nishnaabemwin (aka Eastern) analyzers, and a section for codes from the Southwestern Anishinaabemowin  analyzers. The Nishnaabemwin codes are organized into subsections by whether they appear in both narrow and broad analyses, just in narrow analyses, or just in broad analyses. For now, there is just a single block of Southwestern Anishinaabemowin codes, showing the codes where the code or explanation differs from the narrow Nishnaabemwin analysis.</p>
    <p>Please be patient, it will take a moment for the tables to load.</p>
    <h2>Nishnaabemwin Codes</h2>
    <p>These are all the codes used by the Nishnaabemwin analyzers. Any codes that overlap with the Southwestern Anishinaabemowin analyzer are here.</p>
