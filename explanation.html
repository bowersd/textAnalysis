    <p>This page gives more information about the various analyses performed and the analyzer in general. See below for a description of the analysis process, a description of the complexity measures used for the complexity report, and (probably most importantly) explanations of the grammatical codes.</p>

    <p>When you ask the analyzer to perform an analysis, the site first uses a strict analyzer, then a relaxed analyzer is applied to what the strict analyzer fails on.</p>
    <p>Caveat lector: the most current version of the relaxed analyzer here is too large to host on this site (as of 8/21/2024). The version posted here is a slimmed down older version and in some cases will misanalyze forms that are correctly analyzed by the current version.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>See below for lists of grammatical codes produced by the analyzer. The codes are alphabetized, and broken into sections by whether they appear in both narrow and broad analyses, just in narrow analyses, or just in broad analyses. Please be patient, it will take a moment for the tables to load.</p>
    <p>Here are codes that appear in both narrow and broad analyses:</p>

    <div id="codes_narrow_broad"></div>
    <p>Here are codes that appear only in narrow analyses:</p>
    <div id="codes_narrow"></div>
    <p>Here are codes that appear only in broad analyses:</p>
    <div id="codes_broad"></div>
