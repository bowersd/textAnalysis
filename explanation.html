    <p>See below for lists of grammatical codes produced by the analyzer. All lists are alphabetized. There is a section of codes from the Nishnaabemwin (aka Eastern) analyzers, and a section for codes from the Anishinaabemowin (aka Southwestern) analyzers. The Nishnaabemwin codes are organized into subsections by whether they appear in both narrow and broad analyses, just in narrow analyses, or just in broad analyses. For the Anishinaabemowin analyzer, I have not implemented a system to transform the narrow analyses into the broad analyses. However, the default narrow analyses from the Anishinaabemowin analyzer are much closer to the broad analyses produced by the Nishnaabemwin analyzer, so you can probably piece together what the broad analysis will be without much effort. For now, there is just a single block of Anishinaabemowin codes, showing the codes where the code or explanation differs from the narrow Nishnaabemwin analysis.</p>
    <p>Please be patient, it will take a moment for the tables to load.</p>
    <p>Here are codes that appear in both narrow and broad analyses:</p>

    <div id="codes_narrow_broad"></div>
    <p>Here are codes that appear only in narrow analyses:</p>
    <div id="codes_narrow"></div>
    <p>Here are codes that appear only in broad analyses:</p>
    <div id="codes_broad"></div>
    <p>Here are codes that appear only in narrow Anishinaabemowin analyses:</p>
