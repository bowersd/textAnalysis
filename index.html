    <p>*You can make a plain text file by copy-pasting a Word file into a program like NotePad (Windows) or TextEdit (Mac)**, and then saving with the .txt extension.</p>
    <p>**Mac users: TextEdit has made it slightly more difficult to save true plain text files. Here's a how-to guide (link works as of 3/28/2024): <a href="https://beebom.com/how-save-files-txt-format-textedit-mac/">TextEdit txt saving guide</a></p> 
    <p>You will get the most user-friendly results if you put each sentence on a new line.</p>
    <p>Translation files need to have exactly as many lines as the original text.</p>
    -->
    <!--Coming soon: translation files, txt, json format, short translations, high level analysis, alternate spelling systems (have a light version of page and heavy version?), progress bar, link to fst developmet repo ... load your own analyzer!!, tokenization, capitalization, error fixing (query the analyzer, generate forms, commonly encountered problems), ads-->

    <p>The analysis process first uses a strict analyzer, then a relaxed analyzer is applied to what the strict analyzer fails on.</p>
    <p>Caveat lector: the most current version of the relaxed analyzer here is too large to host on this site (as of 8/21/2024). The version posted here is a slimmed down older version and in some cases will misanalyze forms that are correctly analyzed by the current version.</p>

    <p>Your data is private here!
       When you analyze words/texts on this site, none of that is shared with (or even seen by) the host. Here's why:</p>
    <p>Your browser makes a self-contained file system in your computer's memory when it visits a page.
       All this site does is (1) load an analyzer into this file system, and (2) tell your computer how to use the analyzer.
       When you analyze some text, it goes into the file system to be processed.
       In short, all the analysis work is done on your computer, and none of what you analyze is sent to a server somewhere for processing/storage.
       This is why this service is free (yay!) and your data is as secure as your browser (which is probably pretty secure).</p>

    <p>Gchi-miigwech to Alan Ojiig Corbiere and Amy Debassige for their help testing this tool! Also, so many thanks to Rand Valentine and Mary Ann Corbiere for their help reviewing analyzer output. Alden Jole deserves credit for pointing me towards pyscript and the possibility of a static page. Last, but not least, a great big miigwech to Natasha Cruz, Eli Franz and Zoe Kyriacopoulos for their help processing and finding bugs! None of these people are to blame for the many problems with this site.</p>
