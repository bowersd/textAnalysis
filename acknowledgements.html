    <p>Gchi-miigwech to Alan Ojiig Corbiere and Amy Debassige for their help testing this tool! Also, so many thanks to Rand Valentine and Mary Ann Corbiere for their help reviewing analyzer output. Alden Jole deserves credit for pointing me towards pyscript and the possibility of a static page. Last, but not least, a great big miigwech to Natasha Cruz, Eli Franz and Zoe Kyriacopoulos for their help processing and finding bugs! None of these people are to blame for the many problems with this site.</p>
    <p>This site and the underlying analyzers were created by Dustin Bowers. The source code for the analyzers can be accessed <a href="https://github.com/bowersd/otw">here</a>. The analyzers are ultimately a fork of work done by Dustin Bowers from 2015-2017 in the ALT-lab at the University of Alberta.</p>
