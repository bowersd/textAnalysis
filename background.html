    <h1>Background</h1>
    <p>This page gives more information about the various analyses performed and the analyzer in general. See below for a description of the analysis process, and a description of the complexity measures used for the complexity report.</p>

    <h2>Picking and Applying Analyzers</h2>
    <div id="process_explainer"></div>
    <p>When you ask the site to perform an analysis, the site applies the analyzers in the order specified in step 0 <a href="./index.html">here</a>. Each analyzer is applied to the words that the previous analyzer failed on. Be sure to make the highest priority analyzer be the one that best matches the text overall. </p>
    <p>So which analyzer to choose? The analyzers mainly differ in spelling practice, but now we also have enough analyzers that we can support different dialects! </p>
    <!--p>The relaxed analyzers are large, slow, and less accurate than the strict analyzers. They are so large that they actually are not hosted on this site, and have to be downloaded in the background.</p--!>
    <p>There are currently four analyzers to choose from:
    <ul>
        <li>Nishnaabemwin-kidod</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Dialect zone: Eastern</li>
                <li>Spelling: Chuck Fiero's double vowel system (see the <i>Eastern Ojibwa-Chippewa-Ottawa Dictionary</i> by Richard Rhodes)</li>
                <li>Grammar/Vocabulary: The vocabulary of this analyzer is based on the <a href="https://dictionary.nishnaabemwin.atlas-ling.ca/#/help" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Nishnaabemwin Online Dictionary</i></a>, and the grammar is based on Professor Rand Valentine's <i>Nishnaabemwin Reference Grammar</i>.</li>
                <li>Other notes: These Eastern dialects have dropped many vowels and so can be called Nishnaabemwin instead of Anishinaabemowin. There has been some evolution in the designations of the spelling styles that each analyzer is tuned for. For a while I used the last name of a person associated with the system, but that was a bit cumbersome to remember and didn't quite sit right (see below). The current practice just uses an example word to show how that word is rendered. Specifically, the word is <i>kidod/kidat/ikidod</i> 'if he/she says'. Hopefully this is transparent and informative.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Nishnaabemwin-kidat</li> 
            <ul>
                <li>Dialect zone: Eastern</li>
                <li>Spelling: A popular modification of Chuck Fiero's double vowel system. This style is used in the <a href="https://dictionary.nishnaabemwin.atlas-ling.ca/#/help" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Nishnaabemwin Online Dictionary</i></a></li>
                <li>Grammar/Vocabulary: The vocabulary of this analyzer is based on the <a href="https://dictionary.nishnaabemwin.atlas-ling.ca/#/help" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Nishnaabemwin Online Dictionary</i></a>, and the grammar is based on Rand Valentine's <i>Nishnaabemwin Reference Grammar</i>.</li>
                <li>Other notes: This analyzer is the <i>Nishnaabemwin-kidod</i> analyzer, with another layer to convert the <i>kidod</i> spelling into <i>kidat</i> spelling. Moving from <i>kidod</i> spelling to <i>kidat</i> spelling is seamless, but going the other way can produce hiccups. For a while I called this spelling system the 'Corbiere system' in honor of Professor Maanyaan/Mary Ann Corbiere, who has promoted it. However, when I asked Dr. Corbiere about this, she pointed out that the differences are fairly minor, so branding it with a totally different name seemed inappropriate.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Nishnaabemwin-ikidod</li> 
            <ul>
                <li>Dialect zone: Eastern</li>
                <li>Spelling: Chuck Fiero's double vowel system, but vowels have not been dropped (hence the original first syllable <i>kidod</i> is written). </li>
                <li>Grammar/Vocabulary: The vocabulary of this analyzer is based on the <a href="https://dictionary.nishnaabemwin.atlas-ling.ca/#/help" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Nishnaabemwin Online Dictionary</i></a>, and the grammar is based on Rand Valentine's <i>Nishnaabemwin Reference Grammar</i>.</li>
                <li>Other notes: This analyzer is the <i>Nishnaabemwin-kidod</i> analyzer, but with the vowel dropping rule turned off and a couple other minor adjustments. See <i>The Dog's Children</i> by Angeline Williams for examples of stories from what we are calling the Eastern or Nishnaabemwin region, but with dropped vowels retained, so that instead of <i>kidod</i> you will find <i>ikidod</i> 'if he/she says'.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Anishinaabemowin-ikidod</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Dialect zone: Southwestern (Border Lakes/Minnesota/Wisconsin)</li>
                <li>Spelling: Chuck Fiero's double vowel system, also without dropping vowels.</li>
                <li>Grammar/Vocabulary: The vocabulary of this analyzer is based on the <a href="https://ojibwe.lib.umn.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Ojibwe People's Dictionary</i></a>, and the grammar is based on paradigms collected by Professor Chris Hammerly.</li>
                <li>Divergence alert: This analyzer is not related to the various Nishnaabemwin analyzers above. It was written by a <a href="https://github.com/ELF-Lab/OjibweMorph" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">different team</a> (though for uninteresting reasons this site is using <a href="https://github.com/giellalt/lang-ciw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this version</a>). The Anishinaabemowin analyzer uses a different set of grammatical abbreviations, so the "narrow" analysis field will look fairly different. See below for more discussion of the differences.</li>
            </ul>
    </ul></p>

    <h3>Analysis Format</h3>
    <div id="analysis format"></div>
    <p>The largest differences between the Nishnaabemwin analyzers and the Anishinaabemowin analyzer are that the Nishnaabemwin analyzers are "terse" and "concrete", while the Anishinaabemowin analyzer is what we might call "verbose" and "abstract". The Nishnaabemwin analyzers are terse because, for instance, they only mark plural and add nothing for the singular, leaving the default unstated. Saying that the Anishinaabemowin analyzer is verbose means that either value of "singular" or "plural" is always stated, instead of leaving default values like "singular" unstated.</p> 
    <p>The terseness of the Nishnaabemwin analyzers derives partially from the Nishnaabemwin analyzers being concrete, meaning that they tend to "follow the language". Nishnaabemwin only marks plural and adds nothing for the singular (like most languages), so the Nishnaabemwin analyzers do the same. The language also pervasively uses combinations of affixes to convey information (and some affixes in VTAs are basically instructions for how other combinations of affixes should be interpreted!). Since the Nishnaabemwin analyzers are concrete, they generally represent grammatical information as it comes up in the word, even if what might be expressed in one place in other languages is spread over multiple affixes. The Anishinaabemowin analyzer is abstract, meaning that it combines the information from potentially multiple affixes. This means that the two analyzers drift even further apart in how they represent the language.</p>
    <p>To be clear, I do not think the verbose/abstract approach to analysis is "wrong". Ultimately, the same information is being conveyed by the two systems, so a lot of this comes down to preference for the casual user. The verbose/abstract approach used in the Anishinaabemowin analyzer is direct (everything is fully written out and each tag states everything relevant about itself). It is also approachable, since the great majority of people who have studied languages have not studied Algonquian languages, so it feels more familiar to abstract away from the Algonquian specific combination system. The terse/concrete approach used in the Nishnaabemwin analyzer is granular and faithful to the actual language. Which you prefer is entirely up to you. That said, at some point, serious students of the language should probably have a granular, faithful understanding of how the affixes work. The Nishnaabemwin analyzer obviously supports this directly. How and when students should develop this understanding are important questions.</p>
    <h4>Broad Analysis</h4>
    <p>The site does some extra processing to bridge the gap between the Anishinaabemowin and Nishnaabemwin analyzers, by making a "broad" analysis that is common to both. The broad analysis is abstract (combining information from multiple affixes into a single place), but still terse (not enumerating default values). The "broad" analyses should be consistent between the analyzers. Please contact the author of the site if you find something wrong.</p>
    <h4>Effect on Higher Analyses</h4>
    <p>Higher level analyses that depend on the narrow analyses might not perform identically if you use the Anishinaabemowin analyzer or the Nishnaabemwin analyzers. For instance, the complexity scoring system (see below) counts the amount of morphological information in the analysis. With the Nishnaabemwin analyzers, the complexity score will reflect how many affixes are in the word, while with the Anishinaabemowin analyzer, it will behave more like a traditional word-counting complexity measure as is used in English (though more "informationally heavy" word categories, like VTAs, will contribute more to the complexity score of a sentence than "informationally light" words like adverbs or unpossessed nouns).</p>
    <hr/>
    <h2>Higher Level Analyses</h2>
    <div id="complexity_explainer"></div>
    <p>As neat as the full analysis of a word, sentence or story is, people probably want something further to happen besides just getting the raw analysis. Here we describe (some of) what has already been done. If you have an idea for what else should be done, please reach out!</p>
    <h3>Sentence Sort (by complexity)</h3>
    <p>I created three complexity scores to use for complexity-based sorting, but only one seems to be really useful. So far, the most useful score gives the average number of narrow morphosyntactic features in a sentence. The idea here is that longer sentences/sentences with more morphological information are more complex. This score seems to provide a fairly good distribution of scores that matches our own subjective judgements, and it is what is used when the "Sentence Sort (by complexity)" option is selected. Off the cuff, a score of 20 seems to be a pretty middle of the road score.
    </p>
    <p> Another score represents the average complexity of verbs. There are five major types of verbs in Nishnaabemwin, and I score them as follows (where higher numbers are more complex): VTA=4, VAIO=3, VTI=3, VAI=2, VII=1 (see the grammatical code explanation <a href="./explanation.html">here</a>). In a very small sample of texts, the average scores on these measures did not seem to differ much between texts. These scores may be useful for assessing the difficulty of individual sentences (VTAs have a lot going on! VAIOs and VTIs are simpler than VTAs, but you still have a subject and object to keep track of. VAIs are certainly more elaborate than VIIs).
    </p>
    <p>Finally, the last score represents the proportion of verbs in conjunct vs independent order. If there are more conjunct order verbs, the score is positive. The score is negative if 50% or more of the verbs are in independent order. In my view, this score does not say much about how hard a text is, because both independent order and conjunct order are tricky in their own ways. However, it may be useful to see how far a text leans in a particular direction, so you have an idea of what kind of sentence structures you will be handling (questions, subordinate clauses, relative clauses for conjunct order; main clauses for independent order).</p>
    <p>At some point it would be good to scale the scores according to hard/easy or by grade level, but we do not currently have data about how difficult various texts are for learners or readers.</p>
