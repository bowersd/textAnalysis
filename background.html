    <p>This page gives more information about the various analyses performed and the analyzer in general. See below for a description of the analysis process, and a description of the complexity measures used for the complexity report.</p>
    <hr/>
    <div id="process_explainer"></div>
    <p>When you ask the site to perform an analysis, the site applies the analyzers in the order specified in step 0 <a href="./index.html">here</a>. Each analyzer is applied to the words that the previous analyzer failed on. Be sure to make the highest priority analyzer be the one that best matches the text overall. The analyzers mainly differ in spelling practice, but now we also have enough analyzers that we can support different dialects! </p>
    <!--p>The relaxed analyzers are large, slow, and less accurate than the strict analyzers. They are so large that they actually are not hosted on this site, and have to be downloaded in the background.</p--!>
    <p>There are currently four analyzers to choose from:
    <ul>
        <li>Nishnaabemwin-ekdod</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Dialect zone: Eastern</li>
                <li>Spelling: Chuck Fiero's double vowel system (see the <i>Eastern Ojibwa-Chippewa-Ottawa Dictionary</i> by Richard Rhodes)</li>
                <li>Grammar/Vocabulary: The vocabulary of this analyzer is based on the <a href="https://dictionary.nishnaabemwin.atlas-ling.ca/#/help" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Nishnaabemwin Online Dictionary</i></a>, and the grammar is based on Professor Rand Valentine's <i>Nishnaabemwin Reference Grammar</i>.</li>
                <li>Other notes: These Eastern dialects have dropped many vowels and so can be called Nishnaabemwin instead of Anishinaabemowin. There has been some evolution in the designations of the spelling styles that each analyzer is tuned for. For a while I used the last name of the person who developed the system, but that was a bit cumbersome to remember and didn't quite sit right (see below). The current practice just uses <i>ekdod/ekdot/ekidod</i> 'that which is said', which very concisely shows how the different systems differ. Hopefully this is transparent and informative.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Nishnaabemwin-ekdot</li> 
            <ul>
                <li>Dialect zone: Eastern</li>
                <li>Spelling: A popular modification of Chuck Fiero's double vowel system. This style is used in the <a href="https://dictionary.nishnaabemwin.atlas-ling.ca/#/help" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Nishnaabemwin Online Dictionary</i></a></li>
                <li>Grammar/Vocabulary: The vocabulary of this analyzer is based on the <a href="https://dictionary.nishnaabemwin.atlas-ling.ca/#/help" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Nishnaabemwin Online Dictionary</i></a>, and the grammar is based on Rand Valentine's <i>Nishnaabemwin Reference Grammar</i>.</li>
                <li>Other notes: This analyzer is the <i>Nishnaabemwin-ekdod</i> analyzer, with another layer to convert the <i>ekdod</i> spelling into <i>ekdot</i> spelling. In most cases the conversion is seamless, but there can be some hiccups. For a while I called this spelling system the 'Corbiere system' in honor of Professor Maanyaan/Mary Ann Corbiere, who has promoted it. However, when I asked Dr. Corbiere about this, she pointed out that the differences are fairly minor, so branding it with a totally different name seemed inapproprite.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Nishnaabemwin-ekidod</li> 
            <ul>
                <li>Dialect zone: Eastern</li>
                <li>Spelling: Chuck Fiero's double vowel system, but vowels have not been dropped (hence the original second syllable <i>ekidot</i> is written). </li>
                <li>Grammar/Vocabulary: The vocabulary of this analyzer is based on the <a href="https://dictionary.nishnaabemwin.atlas-ling.ca/#/help" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Nishnaabemwin Online Dictionary</i></a>, and the grammar is based on Rand Valentine's <i>Nishnaabemwin Reference Grammar</i>.</li>
                <li>Other notes: This analyzer is the <i>Nishnaabemwin-ekdod</i> analyzer, but with the vowel dropping rule turned off and a couple other minor adjustments. See <i>The Dog's Children</i> by Angeline Williams for examples of stories from what we are calling the Eastern or Nishnaabemwin region, but with dropped vowels retained, so that instead of <i>ekdod</i> you will find <i>ekidod</i> 'that which is said'.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Anishinaabemowin-ekidod (NEW ANALYZER! This analyzer reflects the Border Lakes and Minnesota/Wisconsin varieties of Ojibwe. The spelling is Fiero's system, again without short vowel removal. It was written by Professor Christopher Hammerly (<a href="https://github.com/ELF-Lab/OjibweMorph" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>project site</i></a>, currently using <a href="https://github.com/giellalt/lang-ciw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>this version</i></a>), and the lexicon is drawn from the <a href="https://ojibwe.lib.umn.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Ojibwe People's Dictionary</i></a> by Nora Livesay and John Nichols. Update 8/11/2025: The site now creates links to OPD entries. I will shortly add some improvements to the link creation system, and better integration of Professor Hammerly's grammatical annotations).</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Dialect zone: Southwestern (Border Lakes/Minnesota/Wisconsin)</li>
                <li>Spelling: Chuck Fiero's double vowel system, also without dropping vowels.</li>
                <li>Grammar/Vocabulary: The vocabulary of this analyzer is based on the <a href="https://ojibwe.lib.umn.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Ojibwe People's Dictionary</i></a>, and the grammar is based on paradigms collected by Professor Chris Hammerly.</li>
                <li>Divergence alert: This analyzer is not related to the various Nishnaabemwin analyzers above. It was written by a <a href="https://github.com/ELF-Lab/OjibweMorph" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>different team</i></a> (though for uninteresting reasons this site is using <a href="https://github.com/giellalt/lang-ciw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>this version</i></a>). The Anishinaabemowin analyzer uses a different set of grammatical abbreviations, so the "narrow" analysis field will look fairly different.</li>
                <li>Partial divergence solution: The site uses a system to convert the "narrow" analyses produced by either type of analyzer into "broad" analysis. The "broad" analyses should be consistent between the analyzers. Please contact the author of the site if you find something wrong.</li>
                <li>Continued divergence: Higher level analyses that depend on the narrow analyses might not perform identically with the <i>Anishinaabemowin-ekidod</i> analyzer. For instance, the complexity scoring system (see below) counts the amount of morphological information in the analysis. The narrow analyses from the Nishnaabemwin analyzers stick very closely to the actual prefixes and suffixes in the words, so the complexity scores reflect how many affixes are in the word. In contrast, the Anishinaabemowin analyzer is fundamentally verbose. For example, words are tagged as "singular" even though in the language there is only a plural marker and singulars have no special suffix. Furthermore, the language pervasively uses combinations of affixes to convey information, but the Anishinaabemowin analyzer collapses this information into a single tag. The ultimate effect of this should be minimal... the morpheme-counting complexity measure will behave more like a word-counting complexity measure, but more "informationally heavy" word categories (like VTAs) will contribute more to the complexity score of a sentence than "informationally light" words like adverbs or unpossessed nouns.</li>
                <li>Comment on analyzer designs: To be clear, I do not think the verbose/collapsing approach to analysis is "wrong". The approach used in the Anishinaabemowin analyzer is direct (everything is fully written out and each tag states everything relevant about itself) and approachable (for the great majority of people who have not studied Algonquian languages, glossing over the Algonquian specific combination system is more familiar). The approach used in the Nishnaabemwin analyzer preserves granularity and faithfulness to the actual language. Ultimately, the same information is being conveyed by the two systems, so a lot of this comes down to preference for the casual user. That said though, at some point, serious students of the language will need to learn where the actual chunks of information are, and how they work together. How and when to make that happen are important questions.</li>
            </ul>

    <div id="complexity_explainer"></div>
    <p>I created three complexity scores to use for complexity-based sorting, but only one seems to be really useful. So far, the most useful score gives the average number of narrow morphosyntactic features in a sentence. The idea here is that longer sentences/sentences with more morphological information are more complex. This score seems to provide a fairly good distribution of scores that matches our own subjective judgements. Off the cuff, a score of 20 seems to be a pretty middle of the road score.
    </p>
    <p> Another score represents the average complexity of verbs. There are five major types of verbs in Nishnaabemwin, and I score them as follows (where higher numbers are more complex): VTA=4, VAIO=3, VTI=3, VAI=2, VII=1 (see the grammatical code explanation <a href="./explanation.html">here</a>). In a very small sample of texts, the average scores on these measures did not seem to differ much between texts. These scores may be useful for assessing the difficulty of individual sentences (VTAs have a lot going on! VAIOs and VTIs are simpler than VTAs, but you still have a subject and object to keep track of. VAIs are certainly more elaborate than VIIs).
    </p>
    <p>Finally, the last score represents the proportion of verbs in conjunct vs independent order. If there are more conjunct order verbs, the score is positive. The score is negative if 50% or more of the verbs are in independent order. In my view, this score does not say much about how hard a text is, because both independent order and conjunct order are tricky in their own ways. However, it may be useful to see how far a text leans in a particular direction, so you have an idea of what kind of sentence structures you will be handling (questions, subordinate clauses, relative clauses for conjunct order; main clauses for independent order).</p>
    <p>At some point it would be good to scale the scores according to hard/easy or by grade level, but we do not currently have data about how difficult various texts are for learners or readers.</p>
