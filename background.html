    <p>This page gives more information about the various analyses performed and the analyzer in general. See below for a description of the analysis process, and a description of the complexity measures used for the complexity report.</p>

    <p>When you ask the analyzer to perform an analysis, the site first uses a strict analyzer, then a relaxed analyzer is applied to what the strict analyzer fails on.</p>
    <p>Caveat lector: the most current version of the relaxed analyzer here is too large to host on this site (as of 8/21/2024). The version posted here is a slimmed down older version and in some cases will misanalyze forms that are correctly analyzed by the current version.</p>

    <p>There are three complexity scores used in the complexity ranking function. The first score represents the average complexity of verbs. There are five major types of verbs in Nishnaabemwin, and I score them as follows (where higher numbers are more complex): VTA=4, VAIO=3, VTI=3, VAI=2, VII=1 (see the grammatical code explanation <a href="./explanation.html">here</a>). The second score represents the proportion of verbs in conjunct vs independent order. If there are more conjunct order verbs, the score is positive. The score is negative if 50% or more of the verbs are in independent order. In my view, this score does not say much about how hard a text is, because both independent order and conjunct order are tricky in their own ways. Finally, the last score gives the average number of morphosyntactic features in a sentence. The idea here is that longer sentences/sentences with more morphological information are more complex.</p>
    <p>At some point it would be good to scale the scores according to hard/easy or by grade level, but we do not currently have data about how difficult various texts are for learners or readers.</p>
