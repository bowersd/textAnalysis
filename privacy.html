    <p>Your data is private here!
       When you analyze words/texts on this site, none of that is shared with (or even seen by) the linguist who runs this site. Here's why:</p>
    <p>Your browser makes a self-contained file system in your computer's memory when it visits a page.
        This site is a static site, so when you visit the site, the following things happen:
        <ol>
            <li>Analyzers are loaded into this file system.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Go <a href="https://github.com/bowersd/otw">here</a> to see the source code behind the analyzers and compiled analyzers.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Instructions that tell your computer how to use an analyzer are loaded into the file system.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Go <a href="https://github.com/bowersd/textAnalysis">here</a> to see the instructions.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
       When you enter some text, it is passed into the file system to be processed according to the instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
       That's it.  I don't keep copies of what you analyze, I don't track you, I don't even keep a record that someone came . In short, all the analysis work is done on your computer, and none of what you analyze is sent to a server that I run somewhere for processing/storage.
       This is why this service is free (yay!) and your data is as secure as your browser (which is probably pretty secure).
    </p>
    <p>
        All that said, I do not know if GitHub (the host organization), or some other party, records who visits this site, or if someone has the ability to track visitors' other web activity. 
        I think I can safely say that no one can track what you do on this specific site, though maybe there is some deep and tricky method that I don't know about.
        If that worries you, find some way to contact me that is agreeable to you, and perhaps we can find a way to get an offline analysis for you.</p>
