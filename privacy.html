    <p>Your data is private here!
       When you analyze words/texts on this site, none of that is shared with (or even seen by) the linguist who runs this site. Here's why:</p>
    <p>Your browser makes a self-contained file system in your computer's memory when it visits a page.
       All this site does is (1) load an analyzer into this file system, and (2) tell your computer how to use the analyzer.
       When you analyze some text, it goes into the file system to be processed.
       In short, all the analysis work is done on your computer, and none of what you analyze is sent to a server somewhere for processing/storage.
       This is why this service is free (yay!) and your data is as secure as your browser (which is probably pretty secure).
        All that said, I cannot rule out the possibility that some other party has an unknown way to capturing what you put through this site.
        If that worries you, find some way to contact me that is agreeable to you, and perhaps we can find a way to get an offline analysis for you.</p>
